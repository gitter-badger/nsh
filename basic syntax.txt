echo "Hello, world"

# setting variables.
# better than bash's a=5, i think
let a = 5

# i guess the '=' could be optional.
# it seems kind of redundant
let b $a

# a mathematical expression can be written
# with brackets around it.
let c (a * 2)
# inside brackets, variables don't have to
# have $ before them

# outside brackets, they do
echo $a

# the exit status of a program can be got
# using ~[...]
let result ~[./hello.py]

# which can also be used inside mathematical
# expressions
let result (~[./main.py] * 5)

# the actual output (stdout) from a program
# can be gotten using ~{...}
let hello '{echo hello}

# for the '[] and ~{} syntax, i'm not sure if
# the leading character should be ~ or something
# else like ' or #, or whatever. what do you think?
